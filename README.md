# SmartList

### Inspiration

During quarantine, we aimed to create a simple yet valuable educational tool. Our goal was to develop something that could enhance student learning. 

### Functionality 

SmartList is a web app designed to organize tasks with a unique levelling system. Create tasks by specifying name, description, difficulty, and importance level. Gain experience and level up as you complete tasks. The site also features a history function for reviewing completed tasks. Easily remove tasks from both lists with a single click.

The best part about the website is that it saves your data even when you leave the page. You can always come back to it later, and all your tasks, levels, and experience will be saved!

### Technologies Used

We built it using ```HTML, CSS, and JavaScript``` (Mainly JS was used to build the points algorithms) 

➼ We first made the input elements and functionality

➼ Made the list functional with the ability to add items

➼ Added functional buttons to the lists

➼ Stored completed/uncompleted tasks

➼ Created functions to save data to localstorage for user data to be saved in the browser

➼ Implemented the experience and the leveling up system 

### Challenges 

Syncing data with local storage, loading data on page load, and updating the page for task creation posed challenges.
