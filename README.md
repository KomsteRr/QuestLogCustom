# SmartList

### Inspiration

As students during the quarantine, we wanted to make something simple but useful for education. Our goal was to brainstorm something that could be used by students to supplement, help, or improve learning in any way. The inspiration finally came after we came up with the idea to make a special to-do list.

### Functionality 

The project is a web app that organizes all your responsibilities in a fun way! The special part of this to-do list comes from the unique leveling system, inspired by RPG games, that allows you to gain experience and level up by creating tasks. You can create new tasks with ease -- state the task name, description, difficulty, and importance. The program calculates the experience given by the task, and when you press complete, you gain that experience! The website also has a history feature that allows you to see completed tasks. You can always remove any tasks from both the completed or to-do list with just the click of a button!

The best part about the website is that it saves your data even when you leave the page! You can always come back to it later, and all your tasks, levels, and experience will be saved!

### Technologies Used

We built it using ```HTML, CSS, and JavaScript``` (Mainly JS was used to build the points algorithms) 

➼ We first made the input elements and functionality

➼ Made the list functional with the ability to add items

➼ Added functional buttons to the lists

➼ Stored completed tasks

➼ Created functions to save data to localstorage for user data to be saved in the browser

➼ Finally, we made the experience and leveling system

### Challenges 

One of the hardest parts was having all the moving parts working together -- saving the data in the local storage, loading that data when the page is loaded, and updating the page when tasks are created. Creating the formatting also was difficult at times, because of the different buttons and sections we had to manage.
